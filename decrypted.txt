THE ROTORS FORMED THE HEART OF AN ENIGMA MACHINE. EACH ROTOR WAS A DISCAPPROXIMATELY TEN CM IN DIAMETER MADE FROM HARD RUBBER OR BAKELITE WITHBRASS SPRING-LOADED PINS ON ONE FACE ARRANGED IN A CIRCLE; ON THE OTHERSIDE ARE A CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF CIRCULAR ELECTRICAL CONTACTS. THE PINSAND CONTACTS REPRESENT THE ALPHABET - TYPICALLY THE 26 LETTERS A-Z (THISWILL BE ASSUMED FOR THE REST OF THIS DESCRIPTION). WHEN THE ROTORS WEREMOUNTED SIDE-BY-SIDE ON THE SPINDLE, THE PINS OF ONE ROTOR RESTED AGAINSTTHE CONTACTS OF THE NEIGHBOURING ROTOR, FORMING AN ELECTRICALCONNECTION. INSIDE THE BODY OF THE ROTOR, TWENTY SIX WIRES CONNECTED EACHPIN ON ONE SIDE TO A CONTACT ON THE OTHER IN A COMPLEX PATTERN. MOST OF THEROTORS WERE IDENTIFIED BY ROMAN NUMERALS, AND EACH ISSUED COPY OF ROTOR IWAS WIRED IDENTICALLY TO ALL OTHERS. THE SAME WAS TRUE FOR THE SPECIAL THINBETA AND GAMMA ROTORS USED IN THE M4 NAVAL VARIANT.THREE ENIGMA ROTORS AND THE SHAFT, ON WHICH THEY ARE PLACED WHEN IN USE.BY ITSELF, A ROTOR PERFORMS ONLY A VERY SIMPLE TYPE OF ENCRYPTION - ASIMPLE SUBSTITUTION CIPHER. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PIN CORRESPONDING TO THELETTER E MIGHT BE WIRED TO THE CONTACT FOR LETTER T ON THE OPPOSITE FACE,AND SO ON. ENIGMA'S SECURITY CAME FROM USING SEVERAL ROTORS IN SERIES(USUALLY THREE OR FOUR) AND THE REGULAR STEPPING MOVEMENT OF THE ROTORS,THUS IMPLEMENTING A POLY-ALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION CIPHER.  WHEN PLACED IN ANENIGMA, EACH ROTOR CAN BE SET TO ONE OF 26 POSSIBLE POSITIONS. WHENINSERTED, IT CAN BE TURNED BY HAND USING THE GROOVED FINGER-WHEEL, WHICHPROTRUDES FROM THE INTERNAL ENIGMA COVER WHEN CLOSED. SO THAT THE OPERATORCAN KNOW THE ROTOR'S POSITION, EACH HAD AN ALPHABET TYRE (OR LETTER RING)ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE ROTOR DISK, WITH 26 CHARACTERS (TYPICALLYLETTERS); ONE OF THESE COULD BE SEEN THROUGH THE WINDOW, THUS INDICATINGTHE ROTATIONAL POSITION OF THE ROTOR. IN EARLY MODELS, THE ALPHABET RINGWAS FIXED TO THE ROTOR DISK. A LATER IMPROVEMENT WAS THE ABILITY TO ADJUSTTHE ALPHABET RING RELATIVE TO THE ROTOR DISK. THE POSITION OF THE RING WASKNOWN AS THE RINGSTELLUNG ("RING SETTING"), AND WAS A PART OF THE INITIALSETTING PRIOR TO AN OPERATING SESSION. IN MODERN TERMS IT WAS A PART OF THEINITIALIZATION VECTOR.TWO ENIGMA ROTORS SHOWING ELECTRICAL CONTACTS, STEPPING RATCHET (ON THELEFT) AND NOTCH (ON THE RIGHT-HAND ROTOR OPPOSITE D).  EACH ROTOR CONTAINEDA NOTCH (OR MORE THAN ONE) THAT CONTROLLED ROTOR STEPPING. IN THE MILITARYVARIANTS, THE NOTCHES ARE LOCATED ON THE ALPHABET RING.  THE ARMY AND AIRFORCE ENIGMAS WERE USED WITH SEVERAL ROTORS, INITIALLY THREE. ON FIFTEENDECEMBER 38, THIS CHANGED TO FIVE, FROM WHICH THREE WERE CHOSEN FOR AGIVEN SESSION. ROTORS WERE MARKED WITH ROMAN NUMERALS TO DISTINGUISH THEM:I, II, III, IV AND V, ALL WITH SINGLE NOTCHES LOCATED AT DIFFERENT POINTSON THE ALPHABET RING. THIS VARIATION WAS PROBABLY INTENDED AS A SECURITYMEASURE, BUT ULTIMATELY ALLOWED THE POLISH CLOCK METHOD AND BRITISHBANBURISMUS ATTACKS.  THE NAVAL VERSION OF THE WEHRMACHT ENIGMA HAD ALWAYSBEEN ISSUED WITH MORE ROTORS THAN THE OTHER SERVICES: AT FIRST SIX, THENSEVEN, AND FINALLY EIGHT. THE ADDITIONAL ROTORS WERE MARKED VI, VII ANDVIII, ALL WITH DIFFERENT WIRING, AND HAD TWO NOTCHES, RESULTING IN MOREFREQUENT TURNOVER. THE FOUR-ROTOR NAVAL ENIGMA (M4) MACHINE ACCOMMODATED ANEXTRA ROTOR IN THE SAME SPACE AS THE THREE-ROTOR VERSION. THIS WASACCOMPLISHED BY REPLACING THE ORIGINAL REFLECTOR WITH A THINNER ONE AND BYADDING A THIN FOURTH ROTOR. THAT FOURTH ROTOR WAS ONE OF TWO TYPES, BETA ORGAMMA, AND NEVER STEPPED, BUT COULD BE MANUALLY SET TO ANY OF 26POSITIONS.THE CURRENT ENTRY WHEEL, OR ENTRY STATOR, CONNECTS THE PLUGBOARD TO THEROTOR ASSEMBLY. IF THE PLUGBOARD IS NOT PRESENT, THE ENTRY WHEEL INSTEADCONNECTS THE KEYBOARD AND LAMPBOARD TO THE ROTOR ASSEMBLY. WHILE THE EXACTWIRING USED IS OF COMPARATIVELY LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO SECURITY, IT PROVED ANOBSTACLE TO REJEWSKI'S PROGRESS DURING HIS STUDY OF THE ROTOR WIRINGS. THECOMMERCIAL ENIGMA CONNECTS THE KEYS IN THE ORDER OF THEIR SEQUENCE ON THEKEYBOARD: QA, WB, EC AND SO ON. HOWEVER, THE MILITARY ENIGMA CONNECTS THEMIN STRAIGHT ALPHABETICAL ORDER: AA, BB, CC, AND SO ON. IT TOOK INSPIREDGUESSWORK FOR REJEWSKI TO PENETRATE THE MODIFICATION.WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MODELS A AND B, THE LAST ROTOR CAME BEFORE AREFLECTOR, A PATENTED FEATURE UNIQUE TO ENIGMA AMONG THE PERIOD'S VARIOUSROTOR MACHINES. THE REFLECTOR CONNECTED OUTPUTS OF THE LAST ROTOR IN PAIRS,REDIRECTING CURRENT BACK THROUGH THE ROTORS BY A DIFFERENT ROUTE. THEREFLECTOR ENSURED THAT ENIGMA IS SELF-RECIPROCAL: CONVENIENTLY, ENCRYPTIONWAS THE SAME AS DECRYPTION. HOWEVER, THE REFLECTOR ALSO GAVE ENIGMA THEPROPERTY THAT NO LETTER EVER ENCRYPTED TO ITSELF. THIS WAS A SEVERECONCEPTUAL FLAW AND A CRYPTOLOGICAL MISTAKE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPLOITED BYCODEBREAKERS.  IN MODEL C, THE REFLECTOR COULD BE INSERTED IN ONE OF TWODIFFERENT POSITIONS. IN MODEL D, THE REFLECTOR COULD BE SET IN 26 POSSIBLEPOSITIONS, ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT MOVE DURING ENCRYPTION. IN THE ABWEHRENIGMA, THE REFLECTOR STEPPED DURING ENCRYPTION IN A MANNER LIKE THE OTHERWHEELS.  IN THE GERMAN ARMY AND AIR FORCE ENIGMA, THE REFLECTOR WAS FIXEDAND DID NOT ROTATE; THERE WERE FOUR VERSIONS. THE ORIGINAL VERSION WASMARKED A, AND WAS REPLACED BY UMKEHRWALZE B ON 1 NOVEMBER 1937. A THIRDVERSION, UMKEHRWALZE C WAS USED BRIEFLY IN 1940, POSSIBLY BY MISTAKE, ANDWAS SOLVED BY HUT 6.[14] THE FOURTH VERSION, FIRST OBSERVED ON 2 JANUARY1944, HAD A REWIREABLE REFLECTOR, CALLED UMKEHRWALZE D, ALLOWING THE ENIGMAOPERATOR TO ALTER THE CONNECTIONS AS PART OF THE KEY SETTINGS.  6 MADE THEMACHINE PERFORM IDENTICALLY TO THE THREE-ROTOR MACHINE.
